** About the Project **

- Domain: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

- Problem Statement: Real Time Danger Detection for Safety of Women Travellers

This project aims to enhance personal safety by providing a proactive monitoring solution. By combining real-time tracking with intelligent risk assessment and alerts, it offers peace of mind and enables quicker response in potentially critical situations.


** Features **

--- ADDED

- GEOLOCATION DATA GPS (Global Positioning System)

- CRIME DATA SOURCES Public Government Datasets (e.g., NCRB India) Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai Lucknow, Haryana

- EMERGENCY NUMBERS

- DETECTION OF THE CURRENT PLACE (Safe or Unsafe)

- SAFE SCORE (Based on Safety Factors like historical data, crowd density)

- HEATMAP generation using GOOGLE maps API [ Maps Javascript API ]


** Future Enhancements **

- COMMUNITY FEEDBACK

- EMERGENCY ALERTS (To Desired Number)


** Technologies used **

- Code Editor - VS Code linked with GitHub Codespaces 

- Language used - TypeScript JSX (.tsx extension)


** Workflow Overview **

The core functionalities of the system can be broken down into the following stages:

* Start: Initiates the system's operation.

- User Onboarding (Register, Login, Permissions):

Registration: New users create an account to access the system's features.

Login: Existing users can securely log in to their profiles.

- Real-time Location Tracking:

Continuously monitors and records the user's geographical position as they move.

- Detects Live Location:

Pinpoints the user's current exact coordinates at any given moment.

Build Heatmaps using Google Maps API & NCRB 2023 Crime Reported against Women throughout the country.

Utilizes the Google Maps API for geographical data integration and visualization.

Leverages data analysis techniques (potentially from Kaggle datasets or similar sources) to process historical location data, crime statistics, or user-reported incidents.

The output is a spatial representation (heatmap) highlighting areas of varying safety levels.

Color Code Zones on Map (Red = Danger, Green = Safe):

Visually categorizes geographical areas on a map based on their assessed safety level:

Red Zones: Indicate areas identified as high-risk or dangerous.

Green Zones: Indicate areas deemed safe or low-risk.

- Purpose 

This system aims to enhance personal safety by providing a proactive monitoring solution. By combining real-time tracking with intelligent risk assessment and automated alerts, it offers peace of mind and enables quicker response in potentially critical situations.
