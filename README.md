REAL TIME DANGER DETECTION FOR SAFETY OF WOMEN TRAVELLERS
This repository outlines the workflow for a real-time location tracking and safety alert system. The system is designed to monitor user movements, identify unusual patterns, and provide alerts when a user enters or remains in potentially dangerous areas.

Workflow Overview
The core functionalities of the system can be broken down into the following stages:

Start: Initiates the system's operation.

User Onboarding (Register, Login, Permissions):

Registration: New users create an account to access the system's features.

Login: Existing users can securely log in to their profiles.

Real-time Location Tracking:

Continuously monitors and records the user's geographical position as they move.

Detect Live Location:

Pinpoints the user's current exact coordinates at any given moment.

Build Heatmaps using Google Maps API & Kaggle:

Utilizes the Google Maps API for geographical data integration and visualization.

Leverages data analysis techniques (potentially from Kaggle datasets or similar sources) to process historical location data, crime statistics, or user-reported incidents.

The output is a spatial representation (heatmap) highlighting areas of varying safety levels.

Color Code Zones on Map (Red = Danger, Green = Safe):

Visually categorizes geographical areas on a map based on their assessed safety level:

Red Zones: Indicate areas identified as high-risk or dangerous.

Green Zones: Indicate areas deemed safe or low-risk.

Remaining Features are to be Added...

Purpose
This system aims to enhance personal safety by providing a proactive monitoring solution. By combining real-time tracking with intelligent risk assessment and automated alerts, it offers peace of mind and enables quicker response in potentially critical situations.
